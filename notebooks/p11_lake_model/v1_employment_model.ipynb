    "> 2. Create a generative model for the data...\n",
    ">   - A first model should be as simple as possible.\n",

    "> 4. Use the artificial data to estimate the model parameters ($\\hat{\\theta})$\n",
    "> 5. Check that you recovered a good approximation of the \"known unknowns\" (aka, $\\theta \\approx \\hat{\\theta}$)\n",
    ">   - Possibly repeat 3-5 with different estimators and true parameters ($\\theta$), to get an understanding of how well the fitting procedure works\n",
    "> 6. Fit the model to your real data, check the fit\n",
    "> 7. Argue about the results with your friends and colleagues\n",
    "> 8. Go back to 2. with a slightly richer model. Repeat.\n",
    "> 9. Think carefully about what decisions will be made from the analysis, encode a loss function, and perform statistical decision analysis... Note that in many cases, we will do step 9 before steps 1-8!\n",
    "\n",
    "Later this semester, we will talk formally about what it means to \"fit\" your model (and the work that it entails), but, for now, we find it sufficient to say that it's a process to ensure that the probability distribution over outcomes generated by your model lines up with the data (aka, finding the right model parameters).\n",
